<h1>Who Am I? </h1>
<p>  <img src = "present.jpg" alt="Presenting Poster" class = "image1" width="302" height = "403"> My name is Ruijie Xu, but most people know me as Rachel. I am an enthusiastic, motivated and committed worker, which are also the qualities led me to decide my path as a bioinformatics researcher. I am currently a senior study in 
the University of Georgia major in Biochemistry and with a certificate in computing.
Upon felling in love with biochemistry at the beginning of my undergraduate years, the unexpected discovery of my interest in computer science and data analyzing through the certificate in computing and using the computing knowledge in my experience as an undergraduate researcher confirmed my passion to pursue a career in bioinformatics. </p>

<p>After exposed to the rough idea of bioinformatics through gene sequencing in my first research project in cloning and heterologous expression of Switchgrass genes, my interest in bioinformatics was motivated. In order to have a deeper understanding of the use of the bioinformatics tools and data analysis, I decided to start taking computing courses to help prepare to enter the world of bioinformatics.</p> 
<p><img src = "DNA sequencing.png" alt = "DNA sequencing" class = "image2">Fortunately, I was able to experience bioinformatics in the lab setting soon after my interest was aroused. Working in the bioinformatics team with the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) helped to train me as a bioinformatics researcher from Scratch. Starting with learning MATLAB programming language to analyzing collected data, my knowledge in bioinformatics had grown rapidly. The more knowledge I was exposed to, the more eager I am to look for the challenge. This starvation for knowledge is what pushed me to pursue a graduate degree in bioinformatics and have bioinformatics as my career in the future.</p>
